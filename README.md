# üè† California Housing Price Prediction - Machine Learning Model

This is a simple machine learning project that predicts housing prices in California using data from the `housing.csv` dataset.

üîó GitHub Repo: [alexmueller07/housing-ML-model](https://github.com/alexmueller07/housing-ML-model/tree/main)

## üß† What It Does

- Loads and processes California housing data
- Trains a regression model to predict house prices
- Evaluates model performance (e.g., Mean Squared Error)
- Outputs predictions

All code is contained in `main.py`, and the dataset should be located in the same directory as `housing.csv`.

## üõ† How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexmueller07/housing-ML-model.git
   cd housing-ML-model
